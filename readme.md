# Regression on Used Cars dataset
By: Jagandeep Singh

## Introduction
I used "Used Cars dataset" from kaggle by Austin Reese. This dataset initially
had 435849 rows. The dataset included price, year, make, model, mileage, condition,
title_status etc. I cleaned the dataset as much as I could. I ran three hypothesis
tests on different columns of the dataset. Main task in this project was to create
model that can predict car prices.
